      <header><h3>GOALS</h3></header>
      <p>
        I hope to be able to achieve a lot of things during the course of this
        program, but my pressing objective at the end of this one year journey,
        is to be an excellent software engineer, able to build websites and web
        applications that meet global standards. Some of my other goals include:
        <ul>
          <li>Building different projects that will prepare me for real world challenges</li>
          <li>Proficiency in various languages and technologies that are relevant in the field of software engineering</li>
          <li>Connecting with talented members of the Altschool community to build a network of world class developers</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <header><h3>MY REASON FOR BEING HERE</h3></header>
      <p>
        I am at Altschool Africa because I believe it is a platform that will
        enable me to achieve my goals of building a career in software
        engineering, just as it as done for thousands of people that have come
        before me. I believe that the environment it provides for learning and
        the community of like-minded individuals will motivate me to do my best
        and also provide the right network for growth.
      </p>
      <header><h3>A SHORT BIOGRAPHY</h3></header>
      <p>
        I am Ibukun Ige, I currently work as a mining engineer in Ogun state, Nigeria and I am glad to be on the Altschool journey in order to be empowered in achieving my dreams. 
        I was born in Lagos state, Nigeria to wonderful parents and had my
        primary education in Lagos before my family moved to Ota, Ogun state. I
        completed my secondary education there, picking up interest in science
        and technology and how they're able to improve the standards of living
        for many people around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I moved on to pursue a degree in Mining Engineering at the Federal
        University of Technology, Akure, where I met incredible people who
        shared my passion for learning and innovation. While I had always been
        fascinated with how things work from a younger age, it was in Akure that
        I realised that I could grow from just accumulating passive knowledge
        about the world, and apply that knowledge into creating new and improved
        solutions for issues that affected society. A major tool for that was
        the Internet and digital technology and I continued to nurture interest
        in developments that was shaping up the world in this field. I made a
        decision to pursue a career path in this industry because of the
        possibilities it offered and how it could be used to transfrom lives
        positively around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I came across Altschool Africa during the course of my search for a
        means of improving myself and building skills that are relevant to
        today's society and I'm confident that this journey will take me several
        steps closer towards meeting my goals. So far, I've been taught the
        basics of programs like HTML, CSS and JavaScript which are the building
        blocks of web development, with time and practise, I will become
        proficient in their use and become exposed to other interesting tools
        like React, Git, NodeJS, etc. I'm quite excited for what the future
        holds.
